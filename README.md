## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```html
<div class="image-wrapper">
  <img
    src="./images/image-header-desktop.jpg"
    alt="employees-talking"
    class="image-header"
  />
</div>
 HTML code block of the image.
```
```css
.image-wrapper {
    display: flex;
    align-items: stretch;
    background-color: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);
}

.image-wrapper img {
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
    opacity: 0.7;
    width: 850px;
}
In order to have an image have a background color:
```



### Continued development
